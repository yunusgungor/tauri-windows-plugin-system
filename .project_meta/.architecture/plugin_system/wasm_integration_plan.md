# WASM Integration Plan for Tauri Windows Plugin System

## Overview
This document outlines the strategy for adding WebAssembly (WASM) support to the Tauri Windows Plugin System. WASM integration will allow plugin developers to create cross-platform plugins that run in a secure sandbox environment, while maintaining compatibility with the existing native plugin ecosystem.

## Strategic Goals
1. Enable platform-independent plugin development
2. Provide enhanced security through WASM's inherent sandboxing
3. Maintain performance parity with native plugins where possible
4. Create a unified API layer that abstracts the implementation differences
5. Support gradual migration path for existing plugin developers

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Architecture
- Create abstraction layer in plugin host to support multiple plugin types
- Implement WASM runtime integration (using Wasmtime)
- Define WASM-specific security boundaries and permission model
- Develop plugin type detection and routing mechanism
- Create basic WASM module loader with memory isolation

### Phase 2: API Bridge
- Implement host-to-WASM function calling mechanism
- Create WASM-to-host callback system
- Develop serialization/deserialization for complex data types
- Implement error handling and propagation across boundary
- Create API compatibility layer for core plugin functionality

### Phase 3: Resource Access & Security
- Implement resource access controls for WASM modules
- Create permission system integration for WASM modules
- Develop memory management and garbage collection strategy
- Implement execution time limits and cooperative multitasking
- Create security monitoring for WASM modules

### Phase 4: Developer Experience
- Create WASM plugin template and scaffolding tools
- Develop WASM-specific debugging capabilities
- Implement hot-reload for WASM modules
- Create documentation and examples for WASM plugin development
- Build performance optimization guidelines

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
- Implement plugin-to-plugin communication for WASM modules
- Create advanced UI integration capabilities
- Develop WASM-specific optimizations for performance critical paths
- Implement shared module system for common libraries
- Create hybrid plugin support (mix of native and WASM components)

## Technical Architecture

### WASM Runtime
- Primary runtime: Wasmtime
- Integration approach: Direct embedding via C API
- WASI support: Limited, controlled subset
- Memory model: Isolated linear memory
- Threading model: Single-threaded initially, multi-threading in phase 5

### API Bridge Design
- Interface: Bidirectional function calling
- Parameter passing: Simple types direct, complex types via shared memory
- Asynchronous operations: Promise-based with completion callbacks
- Error handling: Structured error codes with optional context
- API versioning: Explicit version negotiation

### Security Considerations
- Execution environment: Fully sandboxed with no direct system access
- Resource access: Only through explicit API calls with permission checks
- Memory isolation: No direct access to host memory
- Time limits: Cooperative yielding with watchdog backup
- Code validation: Module validation before execution

### Performance Strategy
- WASM optimization: Enable all compiler optimizations
- Hot path identification: Runtime profiling with optimization hints
- Memory management: Pre-allocated buffers for common operations
- Caching: JIT compilation caching for repeated module loading
- Benchmarking: Comparative metrics against native plugins

## Migration Strategy for Plugin Developers

### Compatibility Layer
- API compatibility: 100% functional parity for core APIs
- Behavioral compatibility: Match native plugin behavior where possible
- Performance expectations: Document any expected performance differences
- Feature support timeline: Clear roadmap for advanced feature support

### Migration Tools
- Code analyzer: Identify native plugin code suitable for WASM migration
- Assisted porting: Semi-automated conversion for common patterns
- Testing framework: Validation of behavior parity after migration
- Hybrid operation: Support for partial migration during transition

### Documentation and Resources
- Migration guide: Step-by-step process with examples
- Best practices: WASM-specific optimization recommendations
- API reference: Comprehensive documentation of WASM plugin API
- Sample plugins: Reference implementations of common plugin types

## Success Criteria
1. WASM plugins can access all critical functionality available to native plugins
2. Security guarantees meet or exceed those of native plugins
3. Performance within 20% of native plugins for common operations
4. Developer experience comparable to native plugin development
5. Seamless user experience regardless of plugin implementation technology

## Timeline and Milestones
- Phase 1 (Foundation): 4 weeks
- Phase 2 (API Bridge): 6 weeks
- Phase 3 (Resource Access): 4 weeks
- Phase 4 (Developer Experience): 3 weeks
- Phase 5 (Advanced Features): 5 weeks
- Total estimated timeline: 22 weeks

## Future Expansion
- Component model support when WASM component model matures
- WebGPU integration for graphics-intensive plugins
- SIMD optimization for performance-critical operations
- Thread-based parallelism when WASM threads are fully supported
- Advanced debugging tools integration
