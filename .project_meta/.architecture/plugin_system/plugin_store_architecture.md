# Plugin Store Architecture

## Overview
This document defines the architecture for the Tauri Windows Plugin System's plugin store, a centralized platform for discovering, distributing, managing, and updating plugins. The store provides a secure and reliable ecosystem for both plugin developers and users.

## Core Components

### 1. Plugin Repository
- Scalable storage system for plugin packages
- Versioning support with release channels (stable, beta, experimental)
- Metadata database with comprehensive plugin information
- Binary storage with redundancy and geographical distribution
- Source code repository integration (optional for open-source plugins)

### 2. Developer Portal
- Developer account management and authentication
- Plugin submission and publishing workflow
- Version management and release processes
- Analytics and user feedback dashboard
- Documentation and support resources
- Revenue and licensing management

### 3. Store Client
- Integrated plugin discovery interface
- Search and filtering capabilities
- Installation and update management
- Plugin configuration and preferences
- License management and activation
- Rating and review system

### 4. Security Services
- Plugin validation and verification
- Code signing and signature verification
- Malware and vulnerability scanning
- Permission analysis and disclosure
- Security rating and certification

### 5. Update System
- Automatic update checking
- Delta updates for bandwidth efficiency
- Version rollback capabilities
- Update scheduling and policies
- Dependency resolution during updates

## Plugin Lifecycle

### Publication Process
1. Developer creates and tests plugin
2. Developer submits plugin to store with required metadata
3. Automated validation checks for security and quality
4. Manual review for policy compliance (if required)
5. Plugin published to store with appropriate visibility

### Installation Process
1. User discovers plugin through store interface
2. User reviews plugin details, permissions, and ratings
3. User initiates installation
4. Store client verifies available space and dependencies
5. Store client downloads and verifies plugin package
6. Plugin is installed and registered with the host application

### Update Process
1. Store client periodically checks for updates
2. Available updates are presented to user (or auto-installed based on preferences)
3. Delta update package is downloaded and verified
4. Plugin is gracefully stopped
5. Update is applied and verified
6. Plugin is restarted with new version

### Removal Process
1. User initiates plugin removal
2. Store client verifies dependencies and impacts
3. Plugin is gracefully stopped
4. Plugin files and configurations are removed
5. Plugin unregistration is confirmed

## Security Architecture

### Plugin Validation
- Static code analysis for security vulnerabilities
- Dynamic analysis in sandbox environment
- Permission and capability verification
- Resource usage profiling
- Third-party dependency scanning

### Digital Signing
- Developer identity verification
- Code signing certificate management
- Chain of trust validation
- Tamper detection through hash verification
- Revocation system for compromised certificates

### User Protection
- Permission-based consent system
- Clear disclosure of plugin capabilities
- Community ratings and reviews
- Usage telemetry for security incidents
- Rapid response system for malicious plugins

## Data Architecture

### Plugin Metadata

}
```

### Plugin Package Format
- Signed ZIP archive with standardized structure
- Manifest file with metadata and integrity information
- Binary assets in platform-specific directories
- Resource files (images, localization, etc.)
- Documentation and help files
- License and legal information

## Scalability Considerations
