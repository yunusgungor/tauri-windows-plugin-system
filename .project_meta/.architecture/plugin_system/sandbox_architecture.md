# Tauri Windows Plugin System - Sandbox Architecture

## Overview
This document defines the sandbox architecture for the Tauri Windows Plugin System, providing strong isolation and security guarantees for plugins. The sandbox ensures that plugins operate within controlled boundaries and cannot compromise system integrity or access unauthorized resources.

## Core Principles
1. **Least Privilege**: Plugins operate with minimal required permissions
2. **Strong Isolation**: Each plugin runs in its own isolated sandbox environment
3. **Resource Constraints**: Hard limits on memory, CPU, and disk usage
4. **Controlled Communication**: All communication occurs through well-defined channels
5. **Failure Containment**: Plugin failures are isolated and do not affect host application

## Sandbox Components

### 1. Plugin Container
- Isolated process-level boundary for each plugin
- Restricted file system access with virtual mounts
- Memory and resource quotas enforced at container level
- Dedicated permission profiles for each plugin

### 2. Security Monitor
- Real-time monitoring of plugin behavior and resource usage
- Anomaly detection for suspicious activities
- Policy enforcement for resource access
- Audit logging of all security-relevant operations

### 3. Communication Gateway
- Secure message-passing interface
- Validation of all messages between plugin and host
- Rate-limiting to prevent DoS attacks
- Protocol versioning and compatibility checks

### 4. Resource Control System
- Fine-grained access control for system resources
- Token-based authorization for elevated operations
- Resource usage throttling and quotas
- Graceful degradation under resource pressure

## WASM Integration Path
- WebAssembly sandbox as alternative execution environment
- WASM module loader with memory isolation
- WASM-specific permission model aligned with native model
- Compatibility layer for unified API access

## Security Boundaries

### Process Level
- Separate process for each plugin
- Windows Job Objects for process containment
- Restricted token for process creation
- Process-level resource quotas

### Memory Level
- Private virtual memory for each plugin
- Shared memory regions with access control
- Memory usage monitoring and limits
- Prevention of memory-based attacks

### API Level
- Permission-based API access
- API call validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting for API calls
- Versioned APIs with security improvements

## Implementation Strategy
1. Implement base sandbox container using Windows security features
2. Build communication channels with validation
3. Develop resource monitoring and control system
4. Integrate permission system with sandbox boundaries
5. Add WASM support with equivalent security guarantees

## Testing & Validation
- Security penetration testing for sandbox escape attempts
- Resource exhaustion tests
- Plugin isolation verification
- Performance impact assessment
- Cross-plugin interference testing

## Future Enhancements
- Hardware-based isolation (when available)
- Dynamic permission adjustment based on behavior
- Advanced threat detection using behavioral analysis
- Enhanced debugging capabilities within sandbox
