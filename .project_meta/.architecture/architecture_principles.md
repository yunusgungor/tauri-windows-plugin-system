# Architecture Principles for Tauri Windows Plugin System

## Core Principles

### 1. Security-First Design
- All plugins operate within a controlled environment with explicit permissions
- Plugin isolation prevents cross-plugin interference
- Strict validation of all plugin inputs and outputs
- Principle of least privilege applied to all plugin operations

### 2. Modularity and Clean Interfaces
- Clear separation of concerns between system components
- Well-defined API contracts between modules
- Minimal dependencies between components
- Plugin API is versioned and backward compatible

### 3. Resilience and Stability
- Plugin failures are contained and do not affect the host application
- Graceful degradation when plugins encounter issues
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Plugins can be enabled/disabled without application restart

### 4. Performance Efficiency
- Minimize overhead in cross-boundary calls
- Efficient memory management for plugin resources
- Asynchronous operations for long-running tasks
- Optimization of critical paths in the plugin loading process

### 5. Developer Experience
- Simple and intuitive plugin development API
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
- Consistent error messages and debugging support
- Streamlined testing and deployment process

### 6. User Experience
- Transparent plugin management for end users
- Clear permission requests with understandable descriptions
- Seamless integration of plugin functionality into the application
- Consistent performance across all plugins

## Architectural Decisions

1. **C ABI for Plugin Interface**: Ensures broad compatibility and stability
2. **ZIP Package Format**: Provides a standard container for plugin resources
3. **JSON Manifest**: Declarative definition of plugin properties and requirements
4. **Permission-Based Security Model**: Explicit permission control for all plugin operations
5. **Asynchronous Events for UI Updates**: Non-blocking updates to maintain UI responsiveness
