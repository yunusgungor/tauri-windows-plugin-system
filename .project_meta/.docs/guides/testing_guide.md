# Tauri Windows Plugin System Testing Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Tauri Windows Plugin System. The testing strategy follows the testing pyramid approach with unit tests at the base, integration tests in the middle, and end-to-end tests at the top, complemented by specialized testing techniques like fuzzing and performance benchmarking.

## Test Structure

The test suite is organized into the following categories:

### Unit Tests

Located in `tests/unit/`, these tests focus on individual components:

- **Plugin Loader**: Tests for manifest validation, package extraction, and DLL loading
- **Plugin Host**: Tests for plugin initialization, teardown, and event handling
- **Permission System**: Tests for permission validation, prompting, and management
- **Plugin Manager**: Tests for plugin installation, enabling/disabling, and lifecycle management
- **UI Integration**: Tests for Tauri command registration and execution

### Integration Tests

Located in `tests/integration/`, these tests verify interactions between components:

- **Plugin Lifecycle**: Tests for complete plugin lifecycle including installation, enabling, disabling, and uninstallation
- **Component Interaction**: Tests for interactions between different system components

### Fuzzing Tests

Located in `tests/fuzzing/`, these tests use randomized inputs to find edge cases:

- **Manifest Fuzzer**: Tests for manifest validation with random inputs
- **Package Fuzzer**: Tests for package validation with corrupted ZIP structures

### End-to-End Tests

Located in `tests/e2e/`, these tests verify the system as a whole:

- **Sample Application**: Tests for plugin installation, functionality execution, and management through the UI

### Performance Benchmarks

Located in `benches/`, these tests measure performance metrics:

- **Plugin Loading**: Benchmarks for package extraction and manifest validation
- **Plugin Initialization**: Benchmarks for plugin context creation and initialization
- **Event Triggering**: Benchmarks for event triggering latency
- **Multi-Plugin Performance**: Benchmarks for system performance with multiple plugins

## Running Tests

### Unit and Integration Tests

Run all tests with:

```bash
cargo test
```

Run a specific test category with:

```bash
cargo test --test unit_tests
cargo test --test integration_tests
```

Run a specific test with:

```bash
cargo test plugin_loader::manifest_tests::test_valid_manifest
```

### Fuzzing Tests

The fuzzing tests require cargo-fuzz. Install it with:

```bash
cargo install cargo-fuzz
```

Run the fuzzing tests with:

```bash
cargo fuzz run manifest_fuzzer
cargo fuzz run package_fuzzer
```

### End-to-End Tests

The E2E tests are marked with `#[ignore]` by default as they require a UI environment. Run them with:

```bash
cargo test --test e2e_tests -- --include-ignored
```

### Performance Benchmarks

Run the benchmarks with:

```bash
cargo bench
```

## Test Coverage

Test coverage reports are generated using [tarpaulin](https://github.com/xd009642/tarpaulin). Install it with:

```bash
cargo install cargo-tarpaulin
```

Generate a coverage report with:

```bash
cargo tarpaulin --out Html --output-dir coverage
```

Coverage metrics are tracked in `.project_meta/.integration/metrics/coverage_report.json`.

## Test Fixtures

Test fixtures are located in `tests/fixtures/` and include:

- Valid and invalid plugin packages
- Test manifests
- Mock DLLs

Fixtures can be regenerated with:

```bash
cargo test --test create_fixtures
```

## Continuous Integration

Tests are automatically run in the CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/test.yml` and includes:

- Running unit and integration tests
- Generating test coverage reports
- Running fuzzing tests for a limited time
- Running performance benchmarks and comparing against baseline

## Quality Standards

The test suite aims to meet the following quality standards:

- Unit test coverage exceeding 80% for all core modules
- Integration test coverage of all public interfaces and component boundaries
- Fuzzing tests for all input validation and parsing components
- End-to-end tests covering all critical user workflows
- Performance benchmarks with established baselines

## Writing New Tests

### Unit Tests

When adding a new feature or fixing a bug:

1. Create a unit test that verifies the expected behavior
2. Ensure the test fails before implementing the fix/feature
3. Implement the fix/feature until the test passes
4. Add integration tests if the change affects multiple components

### Integration Tests

When adding a new interaction between components:

1. Create an integration test that verifies the interaction works correctly
2. Test both the happy path and error conditions

### Fuzzing Tests

When adding new input parsing or validation logic:

1. Update the existing fuzzers or add a new fuzzer targeting the new logic
2. Run the fuzzer to identify potential issues

## Test Maintenance

Regularly update tests when the system changes:

1. Review and update tests when implementing new features
2. Remove or update obsolete tests
3. Keep test fixtures up to date
4. Monitor and address any flaky tests
5. Periodically review and improve test coverage
